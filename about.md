 Hey there!
</p>

I'm Melvin Perera, an aspiring Data Scientist and a nerd at heart. Born and raised in Singapore, I left for the United Kingdom to pursue my university degree. After graduating with an MEng in Aeronautical Engineering from [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), I returned back to Singapore and started on my path to delve into the world of Data Science. I embarked on a 12-week long Data Science Immersive programme at [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/education/data-science-immersive) to sharpen my skills and hone my craft in this exciting field.
